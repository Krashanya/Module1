# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `real` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `imaginary` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `complex_num` using the `complex(real,imaginary)` function.
4. Print the complex number `complex_num`.
5. Print the real part of complex_num.
